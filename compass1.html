According to me I got this idea seeing the trouble we students face during our examination while searching for the room assigned for us to write our exam and these room no&apos;s keep on Changing making us roam here and there in search of them and thus if something is handy and on the go which can get through the location where the room exists the task is almost 90% done and we can concentrate on the last moment prepration also..

According to me this is a great idea helpful for all the students of nizam college who have no exposure to the complete college and are bewildered after looking at a unique room no for their exam purpose,they tend to face difficulty in finding them and also it is in general a good app for those who want to know about the rooms available in the entire college, thanks to Koushik my friend and a innovative guy for coming up with this beautiful idea..

According to me this idea what Koushik have come up with is truly a real time issue and if there is an application which solves such issues is highly commendable, it was a pleasure working with him as part of team Bravo, Koushik is good Android developer it&apos;s not because as if he knows everything but it is because he has desire to know more, as a leader he is no where less, it&apos;s a joy for me to be part of this work i enjoyed it, learned new things and hope this journey goes on and on..

I'm so happy to be apart of this project. It was a beautiful journey and a great experience to work as a team. I'm contented for this opportunity.</br>
In my view, It's a very tragic and complex situation to find rooms in Nizam College especially while searching room for examination purpose. Of course, it has been a bad experience for every Nizamian. In the search of solutions for this, we got this idea and I'm so delightful for our idea get into action today. I'm so proud to be a part of finding a solution for all Nizamians.

According to me this is a great and wonderful idea for those who are not able to explore the college for there room numbers and especially this will be more helpful to those who are physically handicapped this will help them to identify the room numbers easily and they can't explore the college at the time of exams for room numbers they can easily know the exact room where it is located and in which block it is and I am very thankful to Koushik for having me in this great team and thanks for giving me this opportunity.

This Application is very useful and also perfect for locating rooms in Nizam college. Nizam Compass application  is extremely helpful for the students during their exam time. The facility provided by the app is fabulous. I am happy to say that Nizam Compass Application runs even without internet. I am very glad to use this application and the application interface is very easy to operate. I am very proud to be a part of nizamians, They did a very good job by putting their efforts and hardwork. I haven't seen an app like this which is easy to use. Finally, I want to appreciate my lovely friends and brothers who did an excellent job like this....
